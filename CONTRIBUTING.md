# Contributing to ZIA

Thanks for taking an interest in improving ZIA.

## We do not accept pull requests (PRs)

ZIA is distributed under a research / evaluation license with a paid commercial / operational lane. To keep licensing and authorship unambiguous, and to avoid contributor compensation / accounting issues, this project does not accept PRs or external code contributions.

**What we do accept (and value):**
- bug reports (with reproduction steps)
- minimal failing examples
- test cases described in plain English
- suggested fixes in the form of explanations, pseudo-code, or small patch snippets posted in an issue
- documentation corrections and clarity suggestions (via issues)

If you submit code in an issue, treat it as a **suggested patch**: the maintainer may re-implement the idea in their own structure and wording.

## How to report bugs effectively

Please include:
- platform (OS, compiler, Python version if relevant)
- the smallest input that reproduces the problem
- expected vs actual behaviour
- any relevant logs or error messages

## Feature requests

Please include:
- the motivating use case
- expected semantics (especially edge cases)
- suggested tests that would confirm correctness

## Credit

Useful reports and suggestions may be acknowledged in `THANKS.md` and / or release notes.
