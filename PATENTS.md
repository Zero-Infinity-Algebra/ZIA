# Patents and Prior Art (ZIA)

This repository is published with the intent that the technical material in the repository, tagged releases, and associated publications constitute **prior art**.

ZIA is intended to be usable by researchers, educators, and evaluators under the Research License, while requiring a Commercial License for any production/operational use. See `LICENSING.md`.

## Defensive publication intent

The algorithms, semantics, representations, and implementation details in this repository (including documentation, examples, tests, and release artefacts) are publicly disclosed so that third parties cannot credibly claim novelty over the same material later.

If you are reading this because you are considering patenting something “based on” ZIA: please understand that the disclosure here is intended to prevent patents that would restrict research access, impede adoption, or enable extraction.

## Where to cite (stable references)

When citing ZIA or establishing an independent timestamp for what existed when:

1) **Zenodo DOI for the preprint**
	   - Use the Zenodo DOI referenced in the repository README (preferred for the theory/semantics).
2) **Zenodo DOIs for software releases (if enabled)**
	   - If this repository is connected to Zenodo, each tagged GitHub release may have an associated Zenodo DOI.
3) **Tagged GitHub releases**
	   - Use a specific version tag (e.g., `v0.x.y`) and the corresponding release notes as a stable reference.
4) **Commit hashes**
   - For fine-grained references, cite a commit hash (least user-friendly, but unambiguous).

## Patent aggression and license consequences

1. Nothing in this license constitutes a grant of patent rights. The Research License does not grant permission to patent the ideas, algorithms, or methods described in ZIA.
2. The Research License (`LICENSE-RESEARCH.md`) includes a **patent-litigation termination** clause (“patent retaliation”):
	- If a party initiates patent litigation alleging that this Software infringes their patent, then that party’s rights under the Research License terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.
	- This does not prevent filing of patents in jurisdictions that allow software patents, but it is intended to discourage attempts to weaponise patents against the Software or its users.

## No endorsement; forks; misrepresentation

Forks and unofficial distributions are permitted only for uses allowed under the Research License.

Forks must not present themselves as the official implementation or imply endorsement by the copyright holder(s). See `LICENSE-RESEARCH.md`.
