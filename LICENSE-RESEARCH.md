# Zero–Infinity Algebra (ZIA) Research License

Copyright (c) **2026 Mitchell Quinn**  
All rights reserved.

**This is not an OSI-approved open-source license.** It is a research / evaluation license with a separate commercial license for production.

This **Research License** grants limited rights for research / academia, teaching, evaluation, and non-commercial experimentation. **All production / operational use requires a Commercial License.**

---

## 1. Grant of rights (Permitted Uses)

Subject to the restrictions below, permission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person or organisation obtaining a copy of this software and associated documentation files (the “Software”) to:

- use the Software for **Research Use**, **Teaching**, **Evaluation**, and **Non-Commercial Experimentation**;
- copy and modify the Software for those purposes; and
- redistribute the Software (source and / or binaries) only as permitted under Section 3.

Definitions and examples are provided in `LICENSING.md`. In the event of any conflict, this license governs.

---

## 2. Restrictions (What this license does NOT allow)

This Research License does not grant rights for:

### 2.1 Production / operational use
You may not use the Software in **any production or operational environment**, whether open source or closed source, including internal operations and government / defence / intelligence operational contexts beyond research / evaluation / teaching.

### 2.2 Economic value through production / operational use
You may not use the Software in any way that creates **economic value through production / operational use**, including revenue generation, cost reduction, or deployed advantage.

Economic value includes value created for a **for-profit or non-profit organisation**, whether or not money changes hands.

### 2.3 Providing a service (including internal services)
You may not offer the Software as part of a hosted service, managed service, platform offering, or any service relied upon for operational outcomes, including **internal services** used by employees, contractors, or automated systems.

### 2.4 Circumvention
You may not attempt to circumvent these restrictions by recharacterizing production / operational activity as research, teaching, or evaluation.

### 2.5 Non-Commercial Experimentation excludes employer / client / organisation work
For avoidance of doubt: “Non-Commercial Experimentation” excludes work performed on behalf of an employer, client, or organisation, and excludes work intended to inform or enable production / operational deployment.

---

## 3. Redistribution (Source and binaries)

Redistribution of the Software (source and / or binaries) is permitted only if:

- the redistribution is solely for **Permitted Uses** under this Research License; and
- this license text is included with the redistributed Software; and
- all copyright notices are preserved.

Redistribution must not imply that the redistribution is the official implementation or endorsed by the copyright holder(s).

### 3.1 Redistribution of modified versions
You may redistribute modified versions (source and / or binaries) only under the conditions above. Modified versions must carry prominent notices of modification in:

- source headers (where reasonable); and
- any accompanying documentation; and
- any “about”, “version”, or release notes distributed alongside binaries (where applicable).

Such notices must state:
- that the Software has been modified; and
- the nature and date of the modification(s); and
- the modifier’s identity (individual or organisation).

---

## 4. Transition to production / operational use (Not retroactive)

Good-faith Research Use, Teaching, Evaluation, and Non-Commercial Experimentation under this license is **not retroactively charged**.

If a project transitions to production / operational use, a **Commercial License is required from the transition point onward**.

---

## 5. Names, marks, and endorsement

“Zero–Infinity Algebra” and “ZIA” are names used to identify the official implementation.

You may not use these names or any related branding in a way that implies endorsement by, affiliation with, or sponsorship from the copyright holder(s).

### 5.1 Forks and unofficial distributions (soft naming rule)
Forking and redistribution are permitted only for uses allowed under this Research License.

Forks and unofficial distributions may refer to “Zero–Infinity Algebra” or “ZIA” only to truthfully describe that they are a fork or derivative (e.g., “Unofficial fork of ZIA”). They must not present themselves as the official implementation.

Any public fork or redistribution must include prominent notices in the repository description and in accompanying documentation stating that it is:
- unofficial; and
- not endorsed by, affiliated with, or sponsored by the copyright holder(s).

---

## 6. Termination

This license terminates automatically if you breach its terms. Upon termination, you must cease all use and distribution of the Software.

### 6.1 Patent litigation termination (patent retaliation)
If You initiate patent litigation (including a cross-claim or counterclaim) against any entity alleging that the Software, or any portion of the Software, constitutes direct or contributory patent infringement, then all rights granted to You under this Research License terminate as of the date such litigation is filed.

IN NO EVENT SHALL THE COPYRIGHT HOLDER(S) BE LIABLE FOR ANY CLAIM, DAMAGES, OR OTHER LIABILITY, WHETHER IN AN ACTION OF CONTRACT, TORT, OR OTHERWISE, ARISING FROM, OUT OF, OR IN CONNECTION WITH THE SOFTWARE OR THE USE OR OTHER DEALINGS IN THE SOFTWARE.
