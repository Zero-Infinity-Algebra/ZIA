# ZIA Licensing Guide

ZIA is **available under two licenses**:

- `LICENSE-RESEARCH.md` — Research License (free, non-production)
- `LICENSE-COMMERCIAL.md` — Commercial License (required for production / operational use)

**This is not an OSI-approved open-source license.** It is a research / evaluation license with a separate commercial license for production.

If you’re unsure which applies, contact: mitchell.quinn@starcroft.net.

## Quick decision test

### You need a **Commercial License** if **any** of these are true:

1) **Production / operational use**  
You are using ZIA in a real system used for operations, decisions, services, products, deployments, or internal business processes — whether the system is open source or closed source.

2) **Economic value through production / operational use**  
Your use creates economic value *through production / operational use*, including any of:
- revenue generation,
- cost reduction,
- deployed advantage (capability, performance, throughput, risk reduction, or operational outcomes).

Economic value includes value created for a **for-profit or non-profit organization**, whether or not money changes hands.

3) **Government / defence / intelligence operational use**  
Use in operational government / defence / intelligence contexts beyond research, evaluation, or teaching.

4) **Hosted services (including internal services)**  
ZIA is used in a hosted service, managed service, platform offering, or any internal service relied upon by employees, contractors, or automated systems for operational outcomes.

> **No open-source carve-out:** even if your production system is open source, production / operational use still requires a Commercial License.

---

### You can use the **Research License** if **all** of these are true:

1) Your use is **research / academia**, **teaching**, **evaluation**, or **non-commercial experimentation**; and  
2) The work is **not deployed operationally** and does not support an operational system; and  
3) Any value created is not through production / operational use (e.g., learning, publication, peer review, feasibility testing).

## Definitions

### Research Use
Use primarily for generating, validating, or communicating knowledge, including academic research, institutional research (including government labs when used as research), publishing, peer review, reproduction of results, and prototyping that is not deployed operationally.

### Teaching
Use in education, training, coursework, demonstrations, and instructional materials.

### Evaluation
Use to assess suitability, correctness, performance, or semantics **prior to** any production / operational deployment, provided it is not relied upon for operational outcomes.

### Non-Commercial Experimentation
Personal experimentation conducted without commercial intent and **not used** to support production / operations or deployed advantage.

Non-commercial experimentation **excludes** work performed on behalf of an employer, client, or organization, and excludes work intended to inform or enable production / operational deployment.

### Production / Operational Use
Any use that is deployed or relied upon in a real environment, including:
- services, products, and customer-facing systems,
- internal business processes and operational decision-making,
- pipelines that affect production outputs or operational outcomes,
- deployed government / defence / intelligence systems beyond research.

### Economic value through production / operational use
Any direct or indirect benefit **created through production / operational use**, including revenue generation, cost reduction, or deployed advantage (capability, throughput, risk reduction, performance, or operational outcomes).

Economic value includes value created for a **for-profit or non-profit organization**, whether or not money changes hands.

## Not retroactive for good-faith research

If you used ZIA in good faith under the Research License and later transition a project into production / operational use, you need a Commercial License **from the transition point onward**. You do **not** owe retroactive fees for prior research / evaluation / teaching use.

---

## Forks

Forks are allowed for uses permitted under the Research License.

However:
- forks are still bound by the Research vs Commercial boundary; and
- production / operational use of forks still requires a Commercial License; and
- forks must not present themselves as official or endorsed.

Under the **soft naming rule**, forks may refer to “Zero–Infinity Algebra” or “ZIA” only to truthfully describe that they are a fork or derivative (e.g., “Unofficial fork of ZIA”), and must include prominent notices that they are unofficial and not endorsed. See `LICENSE-RESEARCH.md`.

## Examples

### Allowed under the Research License
- A university lab uses ZIA in experiments and publishes a paper.
- A student uses ZIA for a dissertation or coursework.
- A company runs a sandbox evaluation to decide whether to obtain a commercial license, without operational deployment.
- A government lab uses ZIA for research and publishes findings, without operational deployment.

### Requires a Commercial License
- A company uses ZIA in any internal tool that affects operations or decisions.
- A startup ships a product incorporating ZIA.
- A hosted service uses ZIA server-side (SaaS), whether the service is open source or closed source.
- An internal hosted service uses ZIA to support employees, contractors, or automated systems in operations.
- A government / defence / intelligence system uses ZIA operationally (deployment, operational analysis, decision support).
- Any use where ZIA contributes to revenue, cost reduction, or deployed advantage **through production / operational use**.
